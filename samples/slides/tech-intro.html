# Your browser is the IDE

Zero install. Zero setup. Just open and build.

---

## The Problem

- Modern IDEs are heavy — VS Code, WebStorm, Figma...
- Installation takes time and breaks across machines
- Sharing work requires accounts, plugins, or exports
- Creative flow stops the moment setup begins

---

## The Solution

**Single HTML files. Nothing to install.**

- Open in any browser — Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Works offline, on any OS, on any device
- Share by sending one file
- No accounts. No extensions. No build step.
